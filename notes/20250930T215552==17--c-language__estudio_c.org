* Introduction
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that has influenced many modern languages such as C++, Python, and Go.
It is often considered the "mother" of modern programming languages because of its impact on compilers, operating systems, and embedded systems.

This file will serve as a *meta-collection* of my notes and explorations as I learn the C language.

* Why Learn C?
- To understand low-level programming concepts (memory, pointers, stack/heap).
- To strengthen knowledge of how operating systems and compilers work.
- To improve problem-solving skills by working close to hardware.
- To build a strong foundation for learning other languages.

* TODO Learning Goals [0/9]
- [ ] Understand the structure of a C program (headers, main function, etc.).
- [ ] Learn about variables, data types, and operators.
- [ ] Study control flow: conditionals and loops.
- [ ] Explore functions and modular programming.
- [ ] Understand arrays, strings, and pointers.
- [ ] Learn about memory management (malloc, free).
- [ ] Work with files (reading/writing).
- [ ] Practice debugging with tools like gdb.
- [ ] Create small projects to reinforce concepts.

* Roadmap for Notes
This meta-file will reference other Org files or sections dedicated to specific topics:

** Basics
Notes about syntax, compiling, and running first programs.

** Data Types & Variables
Primitive types, type modifiers, constants, and scope.

** Control Flow
Conditionals, loops, switch statements.

** Functions
Declaration, definition, recursion, parameter passing.

** Pointers and Memory
Addressing, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation.

** Data Structures
Arrays, strings, structs, enums, unions.

** Input/Output
Standard I/O, file handling, command-line arguments.

** Advanced Topics
- Preprocessor directives
- Header files and modular programming
- Working with libraries
- Error handling

* Resources
- Book: "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie
- Online: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c
- Practice: https://exercism.org/tracks/c

* Reflections
I will use this section to note progress, difficulties, and insights during my learning journey.
