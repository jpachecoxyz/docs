* Introduction
This archive is written in emacs by me: Ing Javier Pacheco. The lisp programming language is one of my most loved programming languages, is the second language that I like the most. So this archive is intended to be a "guide" to the basics of lisp, and in the future is going to be a org document of course written in emacs.

* Functions:
Define a function called "hi"
When you define a function, you need to use the "defun" keyword an add "()" after the function name, see the "hi()" function below:

#+begin_src lisp
;;; FUNCTIONS
(defun hi()
  (print "Hello World"))

;; To run a function you need to simply called it like the example below:
(hi)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World

* Functions parameters
Inside the "()" of the function names you must add the parameters needed in the defined function:

#+begin_src lisp
;;; FUNCTION PARAMETERS
(defun greet(name)
  (print (concatenate 'string "Hello World! " name)))

(greet "Javier")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World! Javier

* Recursion
In Lisp, recursion is a very common thing, here is an example of recursion, the =factorial= code.

#+begin_src lisp
(defun factorial(num)
  ; The code checks if the parameter is 1, if so returns 1
  (if (<= num 1) 1
      ; else multiplies num times the factorial minus 1 recursively until achieves the nummber 1
      (* num (factorial (- num 1)))))

(print (factorial 5))
#+end_src
